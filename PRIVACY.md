# Privacy Policy — All Build Sound Notifier

**Plugin:** All Build Sound Notifier (`com.landenlabs.build-sound`)
**Publisher:** LanDen Labs - Dennis Lang ([landenlabs.com](https://landenlabs.com))
**Effective date:** 08-Nov-2026

## Summary

All Build Sound Notifier does **not** collect, store, transmit, sell, or share any
personal data or usage data. Everything it does happens locally inside your IDE.

## What the plugin does

The plugin listens for build-finished and app-install/launch events inside
Android Studio (or another IntelliJ Platform IDE) and plays a short tone through
your computer's audio output. The tones are generated in memory; the plugin
never records audio and does not use the microphone.

## Information the plugin uses

- **IDE events:** whether a build succeeded or failed, and when a run
  configuration starts the app on a device. This is used only in memory, at
  the moment it happens, to decide which tone to play. It is not saved or sent
  anywhere.
- **Your settings:** the on/off toggles, volume, tone duration, and the last
  plugin version for which the "installed/updated" notification was shown.
  These are saved on your computer only, in the IDE's own configuration
  directory (`options/build-sound.xml`), using the IDE's standard settings
  storage. They can be removed by uninstalling the plugin and deleting that
  file, or by resetting your IDE settings.

The plugin does not read your source code, project files, file names, build
output, device identifiers, or account information.

## Network access

The plugin makes **no network connections**. It contains no analytics,
telemetry, crash reporting, advertising, or third-party SDKs.

## Third-party services

- **JetBrains Marketplace:** if you install or update the plugin through the
  JetBrains Marketplace, that download is handled by JetBrains and your IDE
  under the [JetBrains Privacy Policy](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/docs/privacy/privacy/).
  The publisher may see aggregate download statistics that JetBrains provides
  to all plugin vendors, which do not identify individual users.
- **GitHub link:** the settings page includes a link to the project's GitHub
  page. Clicking it opens your web browser, and GitHub's own
  [privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement)
  applies to that visit. Nothing is sent unless you click the link.

## Children's privacy

The plugin collects no information from anyone, including children.

## Changes to this policy

If the plugin's behavior changes in a way that affects privacy, this policy
will be updated and the effective date above changed. The current version is
always available in the project repository.
